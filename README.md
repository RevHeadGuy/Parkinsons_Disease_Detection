Parkinson's Disease Detection
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that implements a machine learning-based approach for detecting Parkinson's Disease. The model leverages various supervised learning techniques to analyze medical data and predict whether a person has Parkinson’s Disease.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares the dataset for model training.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes key insights from the dataset.
Feature Engineering: Selects the most important features for better accuracy.
Machine Learning Models: Implements different models for classification.
Evaluation Metrics: Assesses model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
